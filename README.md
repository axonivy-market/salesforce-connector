# salesforce-connector
# Introduction
This Connector builds the Rest API that offers a way to access Salesforce's resources.

A client can be called the Rest API for manipulating the SF(Salesforce) Objects. For Instance, to do a **CRUD** Operation or query to retrieve data.

# Approach
Data is stored on the SF Application as SF Objects.

Call the SF Rest API  to manipulate the SF Objects.

# Use case
For example, We want to get all the **Opportunity** SF Object or want to Create, Read, Update, and Delete that Object.

After calling the SF API, We can show a List of all Opportunities and we can manipulate each of them.

# How to use
